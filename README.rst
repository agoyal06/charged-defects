Charged defects analysis
--------------------------

- potential_alignment.ipynb

   python notebook that implements potential alignment correction to
   defect formation energy of charged defects, calculated using
   simulation package VASP.

- INPUT:

   LOCPOT files (Potential file from VASP, containing only
   electrostatic potential) for both defect and perfect bulk.

- OUTPUT:

   Potential plot to read of short range potential needed to apply
   alignment correction.
