# charged-defects

Charged defects analysis

1. potential_alignment.ipynb - python notebook to implement potential alignment correction to defect formation energy of charged defects, calculated using simulation package VASP.

2. INPUT - LOCPOT files (Potential file from VASP, containing only electrostatic potential) for both defect and perfect bulk

3. OUTPUT - Potential plot to read of short range potential needed to apply alignment correction
